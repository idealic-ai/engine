# Project Invariants

Project-specific rules that extend the shared engine standards. Every command loads this file automatically after the shared `~/.claude/standards/INVARIANTS.md`.

Add your project's architectural rules, naming conventions, framework-specific constraints, and domain logic invariants here.
