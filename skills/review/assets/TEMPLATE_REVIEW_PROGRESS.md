# [Evocative Title — capture the period's theme]
**Tags**: #needs-review
**Filename Convention**: `sessions/[YYYY_MM_DD]_REVIEW_[N]/REVIEW.md`

## Summary
*A single paragraph (3-5 sentences) that captures the big picture: how many sessions, what changed at the highest level, and the overall mood (productive sprint? stabilization? exploration?). Include key numbers woven into prose — never as bullet points.*

## Accomplishments
*Group by THEME, not by session. Each theme gets a ### heading with a short evocative name. Write 1-2 paragraphs per theme as flowing prose — what changed, why it matters, specific numbers woven in naturally. No bullet points, no session names, no "What/Impact/Files" structure. End each theme with what's next or what's risky about this area.*

### [Theme Name — e.g., "The Great Context Diet"]
[1-2 paragraphs of prose. Weave in specific numbers and outcomes. Mention what was done and WHY it matters. End with forward-looking risk or next step.]

### [Theme Name]
[1-2 paragraphs of prose.]

*(3-5 themes typical for a multi-day review. Fewer for single-day.)*

## Blockers & Risks
*Short paragraphs (not bullets) for each active blocker or risk. Bold the title, then explain in 1-3 sentences. Include what's needed to unblock. Use "Smooth sailing — nothing blocking." if clean.*

## Velocity & Patterns
*One paragraph describing the throughput, time distribution across skill types, and the dominant pattern of the period. If multi-day, describe the day-by-day arc (e.g., "Day 1 was raw implementation, Day 2 shifted to hardening, Day 3 was integration"). Weave numbers into sentences.*

## Next Steps
*Numbered list (3-5 items). Each item is 1-2 sentences with enough context to act on. Priority order.*

1.  [Action + why it's next]
2.  [Action + why it's next]
3.  [Action + why it's next]

## Open Questions
*1-3 questions that need team input. Each question is a full sentence with context — not just "What about X?" but "How do we handle X given that Y happened?" Use "All clear — no open questions." if clean.*

## What Keeps Me Up At Night
*1 paragraph of honest, unfiltered risk assessment. What could go wrong? What's fragile? What debt is accumulating? This section is the reviewer's personal take — subjective and valuable.*
