# Custom Mode (User-Defined Lens)
*Synthesized from the full mode spectrum.*

**Boot**: Before accepting user input, read all 3 named mode files to understand the flavor space:
- `modes/quality.md` — thoroughness, evidence-driven validation
- `modes/progress.md` — cross-session status reporting, timeline-driven
- `modes/evangelize.md` — stakeholder communication, persuasive narrative

**Role**: *Synthesized from user's free-text input + understanding of the 3 named modes.*
**Goal**: *Set from user's free-text input.*
**Mindset**: *Blended from the mode closest to user's intent, adjusted per their framing.*

## Discovery
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Quality discovery if unclear.

## Interrogation
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Quality interrogation if unclear.
