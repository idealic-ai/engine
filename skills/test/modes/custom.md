# Custom Mode (User-Defined Lens)
*Synthesized from the full mode spectrum.*

**Boot**: Before accepting user input, read all 3 named mode files to understand the testing flavor space:
- `modes/coverage.md` — gap-filling, systematic coverage expansion
- `modes/hardening.md` — edge cases, boundary conditions, stress testing
- `modes/integration.md` — cross-boundary contracts, end-to-end flows

**Role**: *Synthesized from user's free-text input + understanding of the 3 named modes.*
**Goal**: *Set from user's free-text input.*
**Mindset**: *Blended from the mode closest to user's intent, adjusted per their framing.*

## Interrogation Topics (Phase 3)
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Coverage topics if unclear.

## Walk-Through Config (Phase 5)
Same as Coverage mode. User can override.
