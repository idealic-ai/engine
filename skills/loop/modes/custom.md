# Custom Mode (User-Defined Strategy)
*Synthesized from the full mode spectrum.*

**Boot**: Before accepting user input, read all 3 named mode files to understand the iteration strategy space:
- `modes/precision.md` — surgical iteration, isolate variables, zero regressions
- `modes/exploration.md` — bold changes, seek breakthroughs, tolerate regressions
- `modes/convergence.md` — close gaps, tighten tolerances, harden edge cases

**Role**: *Synthesized from user's free-text input + understanding of the 3 named modes.*
**Goal**: *Set from user's free-text input.*
**Mindset**: *Blended from the mode closest to user's intent, adjusted per their framing.*

## Iteration Focus
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Precision focus if unclear.

## Hypothesis Style
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Precision style if unclear.

## Success Metric
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Precision metric if unclear.
