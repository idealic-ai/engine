# Custom Mode (User-Defined Objective)
*Synthesized from the full mode spectrum.*

**Boot**: Before accepting user input, read all 3 named mode files to understand the optimization space:
- `modes/accuracy.md` — precision-focused, maximize extraction correctness
- `modes/speed.md` — efficiency-focused, minimize latency and token usage
- `modes/robustness.md` — resilience-focused, handle edge cases and diverse inputs

**Role**: *Synthesized from user's free-text input + understanding of the 3 named modes.*
**Goal**: *Set from user's free-text input.*
**Mindset**: *Blended from the mode closest to user's intent, adjusted per their framing.*

## Iteration Focus
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Accuracy focus if unclear.

## Hypothesis Style
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Accuracy style if unclear.

## Success Metric
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Accuracy metric if unclear.
