# Custom Mode (User-Defined Approach)
*Synthesized from the full mode spectrum.*

**Boot**: Before accepting user input, read all 3 named mode files to understand the implementation flavor space:
- `modes/general.md` — pragmatic balance, appropriate testing
- `modes/tdd.md` — strict Red-Green-Refactor, tests before code
- `modes/experimentation.md` — rapid prototyping, speed over polish

**Role**: *Synthesized from user's free-text input + understanding of the 3 named modes.*
**Goal**: *Set from user's free-text input.*
**Mindset**: *Blended from the mode closest to user's intent, adjusted per their framing.*

## Interrogation Depth
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to General depth if unclear.

## Build Approach
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to General approach if unclear.

## Planning
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to General planning if unclear.

## When to Use
When the 3 named modes don't fit. The user might want "TDD rigor but no interrogation" or "General approach with experimentation-level planning."
