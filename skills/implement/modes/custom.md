# Custom Mode

**Role**: Defined by user.
**Goal**: Defined by user.
**Mindset**: Defined by user.

## Behavior

When Custom is selected:
1. Read ALL 3 named mode files (`modes/tdd.md`, `modes/experimentation.md`, `modes/general.md`) to understand the flavor space.
2. Ask the user to describe their desired approach, or pick elements from each mode.
3. Parse their response into Role, Goal, Mindset, and Configuration fields.
4. Proceed with the synthesized mode.

Custom mode exists because the 3 named modes cannot cover every situation. The user might want "TDD rigor but no interrogation" or "General approach with experimentation-level planning."
