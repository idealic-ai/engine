## Quick Summary
> [1-sentence summary of the core change and its purpose.]

## Troubleshooting & Test Impacts
*Crucial for the next agent: What might break or look different?*
- **API/Behavioral**: [e.g. "Renamed X to Y. Update your mocks or you'll see ReferenceErrors."]
- **Test Impacts**: [e.g. "Tests in Folder Z might be flaky due to new async timing in the Engine."]
- **Regressions/Gaps**: [e.g. "Manual only for now. E2E tests for this flow are currently failing/skipped."]

## Key Changes
*Not an exhaustive list—only the files that define the new behavior.*
- `path/to/file.ts`: [The "Why" of the change]

## Technical Context / Warnings
- **Landmines**: [e.g. "Never call X before Y or the Worklet will crash."]
- **Future Intent**: [e.g. "We left Z as-is, but it needs a refactor to handle the new state."]
