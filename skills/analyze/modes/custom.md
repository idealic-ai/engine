# Custom Mode (User-Defined Lens)
*Synthesized from the full mode spectrum.*

**Boot**: Before accepting user input, read all 3 named mode files to understand the flavor space:
- `modes/explore.md` — broad research, curiosity-driven
- `modes/audit.md` — adversarial, risk-focused critique
- `modes/improve.md` — constructive, actionable suggestions

**Role**: *Synthesized from user's free-text input + understanding of the 3 named modes.*
**Goal**: *Set from user's free-text input.*
**Mindset**: *Blended from the mode closest to user's intent, adjusted per their framing.*

## Research Topics (Phase 1)
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Explore topics if unclear.

## Calibration Topics (Phase 2)
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Explore topics if unclear.
