# Custom Mode

## Role
Defined by the user. Read all 3 named modes (Greenfield, Evolution, Split) to understand the flavor space, then accept the user's custom framing.

## Goal
Synthesize a hybrid approach from user input. The user may want:
- Greenfield structure with Evolution's diff awareness
- Split's decomposition focus applied to multiple chapters at once
- A specific role/mindset that doesn't fit named modes

## Mindset
Adapted from user input. Parse the user's framing into role/goal/mindset.

## Configuration

### How to Activate
1. Read `modes/greenfield.md`, `modes/evolution.md`, `modes/split.md`
2. Present the user with the three mode summaries
3. Ask: "What's your custom framing? You can blend modes or define something new."
4. Parse the response into role, goal, mindset, and configuration overrides
5. Announce the synthesized mode before proceeding

### Defaults
If the user provides minimal input, default to Greenfield configuration with medium interrogation depth.
