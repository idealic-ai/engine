# Continue Protocol (Context Overflow Recovery)

**DEPRECATED**: This file is superseded by `§CMD_RESUME_SESSION` (`~/.claude/engine/.directives/commands/CMD_RESUME_SESSION.md`), which is always preloaded by the SessionStart hook.

If you're reading this, execute `§CMD_RESUME_SESSION` instead. The SessionStart hook has already injected dehydrated context and required files from `.state.json`.
