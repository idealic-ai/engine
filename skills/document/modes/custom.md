# Custom Mode (User-Defined Lens)
*Synthesized from the full mode spectrum.*

**Boot**: Before accepting user input, read all 3 named mode files to understand the flavor space:
- `modes/surgical.md` — targeted fixes, scalpel precision
- `modes/audit.md` — read-only verification, gap analysis
- `modes/refine.md` — iterative polish, clarity improvement

**Role**: *Synthesized from user's free-text input + understanding of the 3 named modes.*
**Goal**: *Set from user's free-text input.*
**Mindset**: *Blended from the mode closest to user's intent, adjusted per their framing.*

## Approach
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Surgical approach if unclear.
