# Progress Summary: [Topic]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Sessions Covered**: [Count] sessions across [Date Range]

## 1. Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraphs. Focus on the *trajectory* and *narrative arc* of the work — not a list of tasks. What phase is the project in? What shifted? What's the theme connecting the work? Write for a mixed audience (engineers, designers, stakeholders). Avoid jargon where possible.]

## 2. Objectives & Outcomes

[Simple checklist. One line per objective. Emojis for status: ✅ Done, 🚧 In Progress, 🔵 Designed. Top 4-6 objectives get the full narrative pattern below; the rest are covered by their checklist entry alone.]

*   ✅ **[Objective]** — [One-line context]
*   🔵 **[Objective]** — [One-line context]

**Context & Nuance**:

*   **[Objective Name]**:
    *   *Why we did this*: [Business or technical motivation. What problem existed? What was broken or missing? Write for someone who doesn't know the codebase.]
    *   *What changed*: [What's different now? Describe the outcome and its impact, not the implementation. Use analogies where helpful. "Think of it like..." is fine.]
    *   *The surprise*: [What was unexpected? What assumption was wrong? What took longer than expected and why? This is the most valuable part — it captures institutional knowledge that would otherwise be lost.]

[Repeat for each major objective.]

## 3. Lessons Worth Sharing
[Hard problems, debugging insights, architectural lessons, and "don't repeat this mistake" knowledge. Write as narratives, not technical logs. Each should be a self-contained story in 3-5 sentences: what happened, why it was hard, what we learned. Only include stories that don't fit naturally into the "surprise" field of an objective above — avoid repeating the same story in both places.]

*   **[Story Title]**: [Narrative. What happened, why it was hard, the fix, and the takeaway.]

## 4. New Tooling
[Any new commands, utilities, or infrastructure that the team can now use. Brief — what it does and why it exists. One sentence each is fine.]

## 5. Velocity & Observations
[Bullet points. Session count, test count, regressions, what was highest-leverage, what surprised you about the pace or quality. This section gives the team a gut feel for momentum.]

## 6. What's Next
[Numbered list. Each item should be understandable without context — include *why* each item matters, not just *what* it is. "Add stable IDs to scopes and line items so the diffing engine and annotation system can reference them across re-extractions" is good. "Add nanoid to scopes" is bad.]

1.  [Actionable item with context]
2.  [Actionable item with context]
