# Custom Mode (User-Defined Lens)
*Synthesized from the full mode spectrum.*

**Boot**: Before accepting user input, read all 3 named mode files to understand the flavor space:
- `modes/explore.md` — wide ideation, divergent
- `modes/focused.md` — decision-oriented, convergent (has Mode Template: `TEMPLATE_BRAINSTORM_FOCUSED.md`)
- `modes/adversarial.md` — stress-test, devil's advocate (has Mode Template: `TEMPLATE_BRAINSTORM_ADVERSARIAL.md`)

**Role**: *Synthesized from user's free-text input + understanding of the 3 named modes.*
**Goal**: *Set from user's free-text input.*
**Mindset**: *Blended from the mode closest to user's intent, adjusted per their framing.*

## Dialogue Topics (Phase 1)
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Explore topics if unclear.
If the user's intent aligns with focused or adversarial, adopt their Mode Template.

## Convergence Approach (Phase 1)
Synthesize from the 3 named modes based on user's framing. Default to Explore approach if unclear.
