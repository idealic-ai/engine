### ¶FMT_LIGHT_LIST

**When to use**: Simple 1-2 field entries. Lookup tables, glossaries, short mappings.

**Rules**: No blank lines between items. Bold key, dash separator, value on same line.

```markdown
*   **`session.sh`** — Session lifecycle (activate, phase, deactivate, restart, find)
*   **`log.sh`** — Append-only file writing with timestamp injection
*   **`tag.sh`** — Tag management (add, remove, swap, find)
```
